## What we do

## Solving the Schr√∂dinger equation

$$
(H + V)\Psi = i\hbar\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t}
$$

* Determine ground state
* Molecular properties from perturbation theory

## Paul M. Dirac

*The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large
part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the
difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations
much too complicated to be soluble.* 

*It therefore becomes desirable that
approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be
developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex
atomic systems without too much computation.*

Proc.Roy.Soc. A 123, 94 (1929)

## Numerical bottleneck: integrals

* Discrete representation of state -> basis functions
* Partial differential equations -> Matrix equations
* Electron-electron interactions represented by 4-dimensional tensors


$$ F[p, q] = \sum_{rs} L[p, q, r, s] D[r, s] $$

* Typically the part that is parallelized in QC codes

---

## What we do in practice

* Solve large eigenvalue equations

$$
Ex = \lambda x
$$

* Solve large linear systems of equations

$$
(E-\omega S)N = V^\omega
$$

* Typical dimension $10^6$
* Matrix too large to store
* Solved by iteration

---
## Iterative solvers

* project equation on a reduces space of trial vectors

$$ (b^T(E-wS)b) (b^T N) = (b^T V) $$

* solve small problem with `numpy.linalg.solve` (lapack/mkl)

* calculate residual error - converged when small enough

$$ \tilde N = b(b^T N) $$
$$ R = (E - wS)\tilde N  - V$$

* generate new trial vector and repeat

## Our codes

<img src="bg_header.jpg" height="200">

* The Dalton project http://www.daltonprogram.org
* Research development tool since 1980s
* Mostly Fortran/C
* 1M *SLOC*
* Open-source since 2016
* Successful (mostly) Scandinavian collaboration
* Code has evolved organically over > 30 years

---

### Problems

* No unit tests
* A number of (long) end to end tests
* Difficult to modify/extend



### However

* A lot of man-years invested
* A lot of functionality that will never be reimplemented
* Code will not go away
* Still ok for teaching
